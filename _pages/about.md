Hi there!

I was a Lecturer in the Department of Creative Technologies, Faculty of Computing and AI at Air University start form Fall 2024. Previously, I obtained my MS degree in the Department of Creative Technologies at <a href="https://www.au.edu.pk/" target="_blank">Air University</a> and was working at the Computational Linguistics Research Group under the supervision of Associate Prof. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/imranihsan/" target="_blank"> Dr. Imran Ihsan </a> from Sep, 2021 to Feb, 2025. My research interests lie in the general area of artifiicial intelligence, machine learning and data science, and recently Large Language Models (LLM). Here is my [CV](/files/Tahir_CV.pdf).

However, I strated my PhD from Department of Artificial Intelligence, Korea University, South Korea and Working on AI in Healthcare, Generative AI and Automatic Speech Recognition Projects.
